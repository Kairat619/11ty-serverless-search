# 11ty Serverless Search with Algolia

Algolia has a ton of great front-end tools for creating real-time search in JavaScript, but if you're a Jamstacker and want (need) to fall back to a server-side search and render, what do you do?

11ty Serverless rescues us by rendering a search page on the fly with the same templates as our build-generated pages.
